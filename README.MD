Live Site: https://food-recipe-10.web.app/home

- At first, I created the project and made the header and footer.
- Then implemented the Authentication.
- After that, I created the HOME page and mapped the chefs data.
- Then I did the view recipes button
- Finally I deployed the server in vercel and client side in firebase.
